Without profiling :
total time:      64_290 µs       total cycles :  226_794_180     profiler called 0 times
with :
total time:      96_322 µs       total cycles :  328_414_264     profiler called 900_117 times
using time.Now() instead of rdstcp:
total time:      88_973 µs       profiler called 900_117 times


The profiler is impeding a _lot_

Can we make it quicker ?
